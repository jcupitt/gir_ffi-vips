- need set_value() / get_value() to get / set metadata items

- test ArrayImageConst ... can we use it as a drop-in replacement for
  Vips::ArrayImage?

  need im.cast(:uchar) to work for this, and this needs setting symbols as
  params to enums

  see note in set_value .. have opened issue on this



	how do we turn a symbol into a number when setting an enum?

	example ... this works:

		op = Vips::Operation.new "cast"
		> op.get_property("format").get_value
		=> :ushort
		> op.get_property("format").get_enum
		=> 2
		op.set_property "format", 1

	this does not:

		op = Vips::Operation.new "cast"
		op.set_property "format", :ushort

	try:

> op.get_property("format").g_type
=> 45122240
> GObject.type_name 45122240
=> "VipsBandFormat"
> Vips::BandFormat.get_gtype
=> 45122240
> a = GObject.type_class_peek 45122240
=> #<GObject::TypeClass:0x00000002b28c28 @struct=#<GObject::TypeClass::Struct:0x00000002b28c00>>

	a is not the same as Vips::BandFormat :-( we can't use it to convert
	:ushort to a number

  how do we convert 45122240 into the ruby class that wraps it?

  how about 

  	op = Vips::Operation.new "cast"
	gtype = op.get_property("format").g_type
	name = GObject.type_name gtype
	=> "VipsBandFormat"

  now drop the prefix and see if Vips:: has that as a member
