- try:

	x.min :x => true, :y => true, :size => 10, :x_array => true

	  Vips::Error: No such option 'x_array',

  need to change _ to - ?

- looks like we need to unref on finalize, waiting on help

- needs docs for .width, .height etc. 

- what about docs for VipsPrecision etc. ?

- something to make a VipsInterpolate from a symbol

- ARGV handling? 

- test suite

  just test binding, no need to test vips
