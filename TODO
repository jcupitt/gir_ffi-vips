- looks like we need to unref on finalize, waiting on help

- what about docs for VipsPrecision etc. ? can we just refer to the libvips
  API docs? we do thaht for VipsAccess in the intro

- something to make a VipsInterpolate from a symbol? try calling affine and
  setting an interpolator

	x = Vips::Interpolate.new "bilinear"

  works ... try adding code to set_value

  add a note on this to the intro

- test suite

  just test binding, no need to test vips

- why doesn't this example code work?

# == Command-line option parsing
#
# GLib includes a command-line option parser, and libvips defines a set of 
# standard flags you can use with it. For example:
#
#   require 'vips8'
#
#   context = GLib::OptionContext.new " - test stuff"
#   main_group = GLib::OptionGroup "main", 
#     "Main options", "Main options for this program", nil
#   context.set_main_group main_group
#   Vips::add_option_entries main_group
#   context.parse ARGV
#
