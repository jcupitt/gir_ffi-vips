- need set_value() / get_value() to get / set metadata items

- more rdoc comments

  something to make rdoc comments for dynamic vips operations?

- test ArrayImageConst ... can we use it as a drop-in replacement for
  Vips::ArrayImage?

  need im.cast(:uchar) to work for this, and this needs setting symbols as
  params to enums

  see note in set_value .. have opened issue on this
