- need im.write(im)

- try

	$ ./test_vips8_1.rb
	./test_vips8_1.rb:23:in `<main>': undefined method `add' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)


- test ArrayImageConst ... can we use it as a drop-in replacement for
  Vips::ArrayImage?

  need im.cast(:uchar) to work for this, and this needs setting symbols as
  params to enums

  see note in set_value .. have opened issue on this
