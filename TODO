- need im.write(im)

- try

	> require './vips8'
	=> true
	> im = Vips::Image::black 100, 100, :bands => 12
	=> nil

- test ArrayImageConst ... can we use it as a drop-in replacement for
  Vips::ArrayImage?

  need im.cast(:uchar) to work for this, and this needs setting symbols as
  params to enums

  see note in set_value .. have opened issue on this
