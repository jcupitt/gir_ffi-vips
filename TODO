- leak problem!

	require 'vips8'

	x = Vips::Image.new
	x = nil

	GC.enable 
	GC.start
	GC.start
	GC.start
	GC.start
	^D

  the image is never unreffed, argh

  was this mentioned in the gir_ffi docs? check

- something to make a VipsInterpolate from a symbol

- have another go with :include:, surely there's some way we could do it

- ARGV handling

- test suite
